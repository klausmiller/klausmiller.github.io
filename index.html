            <p>
                I am an Assistant Professor in the Marketing Department at
                <a href="https://www.hec.edu/">HEC Paris</a> and a Chairholder at the
                <a href="https://www.hi-paris.fr/">Hi!PARIS Center</a> on Data Analytics
                and Artificial Intelligence for Science, Business and Society. I joined from
                Goethe University in Frankfurt in 2021.
            </p>

            <p>
                My research sits at the intersection of quantitative marketing, economics,
                and information systems, focusing on online advertising and privacy in the
                digital economy. I combine econometric methods, causal machine learning,
                and large-scale experiments.
            </p>

            <p>
                During my Ph.D., as a post-doctoral scholar and afterward, I have been a frequent
                visiting scholar at the <a href="https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/">Wharton School</a>
                of the University of Pennsylvania and the
                <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/">Graduate School of Business</a> at Stanford
                University. My research has been published in top-tier academic journals such as the
                <span class="venue">Journal of Marketing Research</span> and the
                <span class="venue">International Journal of Research in Marketing</span>, as well as
                management-oriented journals. In my research projects, I often collaborate with the
                industry to answer research questions at scale.
            </p>

            <p>
                I frequently review for leading academic journals such as
                <span class="venue">Nature</span>, <span class="venue">Management Science</span>,
                <span class="venue">Marketing Science</span>,
                <span class="venue">Journal of Marketing Research</span>, and
                <span class="venue">Information Systems Research</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2017, I was nominated as a Junior Faculty Consortium Fellow at the
                International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), and in 2022,
                I was nominated as an ISMS Early-Career Scholar. From 2019&ndash;2025, I am a
                co-investigator on an European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant studying the
                impact of Online Tracking Restrictions on the Online Advertising Market.
            </p>

            <p>
                I received the IJRM Best Paper Award 2024 for my work on the
                Economic Consequences of Online Tracking Restrictions published in the
                <span class="venue">International Journal of Research in Marketing</span> (IJRM).
                Alongside Yufei Shen and Xitong Li, I was honored with the Enginius Doctoral
                Dissertation Award (2nd Place) at EMAC 2024.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am a co-organizer of the
                <a href="https://www.digitaleconomics-paris.fr/conference-2025">Paris Digital Economics Conference 2026</a>,
                an annual event that brings together researchers on the economics of digital platforms
                and technology markets.
